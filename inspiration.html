    <h1>Inspirational Quotes to Help You Overcome Addiction </h1>

    <p>On a personal level, I know inspirational quotes and phrases have given
        me strength in the past – especially when I was at my lowest. Those same
        quotes and phrases have also helped me make the right decisions when I was
        contemplating major changes in my life.</p>

    <h2>Putting the Power of Words to Work For You</h2>

    <p>As humans, when things get tough, we have a tendency to fall back into
        our old (unhealthy) patterns. In order to overcome an addiction – something
        that takes a lot of hard work and personal dedication – we desperately need
        support and encouragement. When we read powerful and inspiring quotes, they
        make sense to us. The words resonate with us internally and have a positive
        impact; they give us the push we need on our way to becoming our best selves.</p>

    <p><strong>If you’re sick and tired of being sick and tired and contemplating sobriety,
            take a look at the five quotes below. They might just inspire you to take the first
            step towards the rest of your life.</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li><b>“It won’t be like this forever.”</b>Addiction makes a person feel hopeless and trapped.
            It controls us and makes us forget who we used to be. But the path of recovery is a step
            towards gaining control of your life once again. You no longer have to be a slave to the
            disease. And with sobriety, it is possible to gain back that sense of freedom you felt you
            lost so long ago.</li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
        <li><b>"No matter what the situation is, remind yourself"'I have a choice.'</b> Ultimately, it’s up to
            us – and us alone – to come out of denial and make the first step
            towards recovery. Likewise, when we’re faced with an unexpected setback or a strong urge to use,
            we have the power to determine the outcome. Effective treatment can help us identify and overcome
            our triggers, as well as allow us to make our own decisions about how to respond.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>“You are stronger than you think.”</b>A lot of us think there’s no way we’ll ever be able to give up
            drugs or alcohol, but we underestimate the strength within ourselves. Sure, the easier route may be
            to give up and go back to our old ways, but we are fully capable of beating this disease once and for
            all. All it takes is focus, determination, and hard work.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>“When everything seems like an uphill struggle, just think of the view from the top.”</b>Nobody ever
            said getting clean was easy, and it takes discipline to maintain it long-term. And while the uphill
            climb may seem impossible at first, the end result is one of the most rewarding accomplishments you’ll
            ever experience. The reward is regaining your life and reaching your true potential, making the hard
            work at the beginning totally worth it.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>“You’re worth it.</b>”Many of us suffer from low self-esteem, which, in turn, perpetuates the cycle of
            addiction. But struggling with an addiction doesn’t mean we’re incapable, weak, or unworthy. And it
            certainly doesn’t mean we can’t change our lives around and move past the disease that has been holding us
            back.
            We are all worthy of being happy and of living our lives to the fullest. Embrace your worth as a human being
            and
            never settle for anything less than the healthy, happy, and sober life you deserve.</li>
    </ul>
