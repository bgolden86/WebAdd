            <p><b>CORE</b> is a non-profit Christian ministry designed as an intentional and dedicated outreach to the
                alcoholic and addicted of the community of the Branson, Missouri
                area. In a cooperative effort with concerned community leaders, the local base was established in 1995
                as an outreach to the “working poor” of the area during the economic
                expansion of the mid-nineties. Since that time, the ministry has evolved to include housing as well as
                supportive and instructional services to addicts and alcoholics in our
                community. <strong>Click Here!</strong>
