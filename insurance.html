        <p><b>CenterPointe Hospital</b> provides inpatient detoxification from alcohol, opiates and benzodiazepines.
            CenterPointe’s medically assisted detoxification is a process that allows the body to safely cleanse
            itself of toxins built up from drug and alcohol abuse while managing the symptoms of withdrawal.
            Detoxification is usually the first stepping-stone to a comfortable and safe addiction recovery.

            <p><b>MidWest</b> Our drug and alcohol rehab offers various levels of care and an individualized approach to
                treatment.
                But, while each client’s program varies based on their needs and circumstances the basic overview of
                this
                treatment
                does not. Clients in Midwest Institute for Addiction’s programs will receive medical care, mental health
                care, and
                behavioral care; we label these elements physical, mental, and behavioral. A brief description of each
                element of
                care is provided below. <strong>Click Here!</strong>
