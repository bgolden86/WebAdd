        <h2>What Is a Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
        <p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance despite
            harmful consequencea. People with SUD have an intense focus on using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol,
            tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where the person’s ability to function in day-to-day life becomes
            impaired.
            People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. The most severe
            SUDs are
            sometimes called addictions.</p>

        <p>People with a substance use disorder may have distorted thinking and behaviors. Changes in the brain’s
            structure
            and function are what cause people to have intense cravings, changes in personality, abnormal movements, and
            other
            behaviors. Brain imaging studies show changes in the areas of the brain that relate to judgment, decision
            making,
            learning, memory, and behavioral control.</p>
        <p>Repeated substance use can cause changes in how the brain functions. These changes can last long after the
            immediate
            effects of the substance wears off, or in other words, after the period of intoxication. Intoxication is the
            intense pleasure,
            euphoria, calm, increased perception and sense, and other feelings that are caused by the substance.
            Intoxication symptoms are
            different for each substance.</p>
        <p>When someone has a substance use disorder, they usually build up a tolerance to the substance, meaning they
            need larger amounts
            to feel the effects. </p>
        <p>People with substance use and behavioral addictions may be aware of their problem but not be able to stop
            even if they want and
            try to. The addiction may cause physical and psychological problems as well as interpersonal problems such
            as with family members
            and friends or at work. Alcohol and drug use is one of the leading causes of preventable illnesses and
            premature death nationwide.
        </p>
        <h2>Who Can Develop an Addiction?</h2>
        <p>It is possible for people of all ages, backgrounds, and socioeconomic groups to develop addictions to alcohol
            or drugs. Although
            some groups are more vulnerable than others, there are several factors that contribute to the onset of
            addiction. </p>
