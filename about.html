    <h2>About Me</h2>



    <p>Through my own struggles and journey. I have found inspiration through my little sister.
        I went back to college in my 30â€™s. I worked full time and took a full course of college courses.
        Probably one the most challenging task is keeping up on college courses and working full time.</p>

    <p><img src="kristanme.jpg" alt="kristanme" style="width:280px;height:280px;margin-left:15px;">

    <p>About a semester or two into college, my little sister decided to get sober. Being the
        one who deals with a lot of the nitty and gritty fundamentals in the family, it was my job to find
        her a rehab. Believe it or not...I found trying to find my sister a rehab with no insurance or just
        Medicare difficult. I cannot tell you how much time I spent on the internet and phone, trying to find
        a rehab that would accept Medicare or be free. At the time I did not have much time between work and college.
        <strong>I find it to be a shame that in Missouri you cannot find
            a rehab in a limited time.</strong> It takes hours just to search for a rehab that you can either afford
        or that
        accepts your insurance and then another couple of hours to find out you cannot get into the rehab any time soon.
    </p>

    <p>I have been inspired through my sister to create a website to help others find rehabs in Missouri.
        I am not done with the website and if I am missing a rehab, please use my email address down below.</p>

    <pre>For my sister,

I am blessed to have a sister like you. And, I am not just saying this to make you feel better,
but I am saying that because you really make me proud. Whenever I look at you, I see a beautiful soul.
Your creativity, dedication, and decisions towards things you do always inspires me to be like you because
theses are the things that make you so special.

I have seen you grow from a baby into a responsible young woman. I am proud of the person you have become
and the person you keep becoming. From working on your handwriting in school to working on your personality,
you have taken every challenge seriously and made a point to never give up.

I just want to tell you that no matter how old you get, you will always find me next to you. I love you
the most and I will always love you, no matter how much we fight. Thank you for teaching me every day and
inspiring me.

Love always,

Brittany</pre>
