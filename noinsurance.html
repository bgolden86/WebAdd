            <p><b>Shelter KC.</b> Our long-term recovery program is for men who desire to go a different direction in
                life and face a destructive drug and/or alcohol addiction.
                We offer a Gospel-based recovery program called Christian Community of Recovery (C-COR). Today, many men
                have successfully completed C-COR and they are clean,
                sober, active in church, employed in a career and experiencing the “abundant life” Jesus offers.

            <p><b>CORE</b> is a non-profit Christian ministry designed as an intentional and dedicated outreach to the
                alcoholic and addicted of the community of the Branson,
                Missouri area. In a cooperative effort with concerned community leaders, the local base was established
                in 1995 as an outreach to the “working poor” of the
                area during the economic expansion of the mid-nineties. Since that time, the ministry has evolved to
                include housing as well as supportive and instructional
                services to addicts and alcoholics in our community. <strong>Click Here!</strong> <a
